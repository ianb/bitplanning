# bitplanning

Reading the [AIMA](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/) chapter on Classical Planning (Chapter 10), I got to thinking about approaches.  This is an approach.

The best way to use this is, with Python 3, and `pip install jupyter tempita`, run `jupyter notebook` and load the `Planner.ipynb` file.  You can also look at the source, probably starting with `domain.py`

To view the notebook without running it, see the [PDF export](https://github.com/ianb/bitplanning/blob/master/Planner.pdf) (or [download](https://github.com/ianb/bitplanning/raw/master/Planner.pdf)).
