# bitplanning

Reading the [AIMA](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/) chapter on Classical Planning (Chapter 10), I got to thinking about approaches.  This is an approach.

The best way to use this is, with Python 3, and `pip install jupyter tempita`, run `jupyter notebook` and load the `Planner.ipynb` file.  You can also look at the source, probably starting with `domain.py` (maybe the [solve](https://github.com/ianb/bitplanning/blob/master/domain.py#L540-L614) method).

You can [view the notebook through GitHub](https://github.com/ianb/bitplanning/blob/master/Planner.ipynb), which discusses more details than this README.
